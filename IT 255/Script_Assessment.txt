These are the commands I used to create my script for the final:

#!/bin/bash

free -m > Free_Space_Content.txt

ls -l ~/workspace/OLD/ > OLD_Content.txt

echo $(date) > Time_File.txt

cp ~/workspace/OLD/Free_Space_Content_OLD.txt ~/workspace/BACKUP/Free_Space_Content_BACKUP.txt

cp ~/workspace/OLD/Directory_Content_OLD.txt ~/workspace/BACKUP/Directory_Content_BACKUP.txt

cp ~/workspace/OLD/Time_File_OLD.txt ~/workspace/BACKUP/Time_File_BACKUP.txt

mv ~/workspace/New/* ~/workspace/BACKUP/

:wq

chmod +x Joseph_Silva.sh

./Joseph_Silva.sh

The script was a success. A new file titled OLD_Content.txt was created in the New Directory and the OLD_Content.txt had a list of the files in the OLD Directory. All the files that were in the New Directory were moved the BACKUP Directory.
